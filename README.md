MeetingApp is a web app to manage the meetings.

The App has been built with the PHP framework Laravel.

The database used is MySQL.

The fake SMTP server to send emails is Mailtrap (quite slow), so the emails to advise the participants when a meeting is created, updated or deleted are not really sent.

When the meeting is created, the app checks if the participants or the rooms are already occupied at that time.

You can see the app in the following url:

With the following credentials you will have admin permissions (edit the data freely):

email: karld@gmail.com

password: karld
